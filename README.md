## About the Project
EasyWallet is a mobile app I developed as the final project for my Mobile Development class. Built with simplicity and user engagement in mind, it offers a seamless and intuitive way to track monthly expenses.

What sets EasyWallet apart is its unique blend of functionality and motivation:

- ðŸ“° News Feed: Stay informed with curated updates on finance, sports, and technology.

- ðŸ’¬ Daily Inspiration: Get a fresh motivational quote each day to keep you focused on your goals.

- ðŸ§¾ Effortless Tracking: Quickly log expenses and view a monthly summary at a glance.

- âš¡ Jetpack Compose UI: Built with modern Android tools for a smooth, responsive experience.

The app is designed to feel less like a chore and more like a companion in your financial journey. Whether youâ€™re tracking a coffee or planning bigger savings, EasyWallet makes it easy, motivating, and rewarding.

My goal was to build more than just a budgeting tool â€” I wanted to create something that helps users build better habits, stay inspired, and take control of their finances one small step at a time.
