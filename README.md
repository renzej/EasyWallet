## About the Project
EasyWallet is a mobile app I developed for my final project in my Mobile Development class. Designed with simplicity
and user engagement in mind, it helps users track expenses intuitively and efficiently.
What sets EasyWallet apart from other tracking apps is that there is a news feed section to keep the user updated about
current events be financial, sports, and technology. Also you're given an inspirational code everyday to keep 
motivating you to pursue your goals.
The app is built using Jetpack Compose to ensure a modern, responsive interface. Every design decision focuses on usability,
especially for users who want to manage their finances efficiently on the go.
